## Overview
The MERN Grocery Store Application is designed to efficiently manage product information. Within this application, users can input details about grocery items, such as their name, category, price, product image, and description. This information is then presented in a clear tabular format, complete with the relevant details and accompanying images, for easy reference.


## Technologies

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Axios: HTTP client for making API requests.


## Installation


To get started with the front-end repository, first clone the repository onto your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/33kumarram/grocerystorefrontend.git


Next, navigate into the cloned repository and install any dependencies:

cd grocerystorefrontend

npm install

You will also need to create a .env file in the root of the project directory, containing the following environment variables: 

REACT_APP_API_URL = API endpoint to make requests to the server. 

Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are set, start the development server:

npm start

The front-end application should now be running on http://localhost:3000, and any changes made to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.
